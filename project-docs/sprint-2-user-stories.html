        <h3>Acceptance Criteria:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Schedule library is installed and configured correctly</li>
            <li>Main function successfully orchestrates the entire process from data retrieval to upload</li>
            <li>Scheduling logic correctly triggers the process daily at 9:30 AM</li>
            <li>Error handling successfully manages any scheduling issues</li>
            <li>Logs are generated for each scheduled run, including start time, end time, and outcome</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="user-story">
        <h2>[US-007] Error Handling and Logging Enhancements</h2>
        <p><strong>As a</strong> developer,<br>
        <strong>I want to</strong> implement comprehensive error handling and logging across all modules,<br>
        <strong>So that</strong> issues can be quickly identified, diagnosed, and resolved.</p>
        
        <h3>Tasks:</h3>
        <div class="task">
