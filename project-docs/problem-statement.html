    <h1>Problem Statement: Best Ball Rankings Agent</h1>

    <p>The fantasy sports industry requires up-to-date player rankings for effective decision-making in draft strategies. However, manually updating these rankings across different platforms can be time-consuming and prone to errors. There is a need for an automated solution that can efficiently retrieve, process, and upload the latest player rankings from a trusted source to a popular fantasy sports platform.</p>

    <h2>Current Challenges:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Daily manual retrieval of rankings from establishtherun.com</li>
        <li>Potential for human error in data transfer</li>
        <li>Time-consuming process of uploading rankings to DraftKings</li>
        <li>Lack of consistent timing for updates</li>
        <li>No automated notification system for successful updates</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Proposed Solution:</h2>
    <p>Develop a Best Ball Rankings Agent, a command-line tool that automates the entire process of gathering rankings from establishtherun.com and uploading them to DraftKings. This agent will follow a Sequential Agent Workflow, executing the following steps:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Trigger automatically at 9:30 AM daily</li>
        <li>Retrieve the latest CSV rankings from establishtherun.com using web scraping techniques</li>
        <li>Process and format the retrieved data using an AI-powered language model</li>
        <li>Upload the formatted rankings to DraftKings</li>
        <li>Send notifications about the update status</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Expected Outcomes:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Elimination of manual data entry and associated errors</li>
        <li>Consistent daily updates of rankings at a specified time</li>
        <li>Improved efficiency in managing fantasy sports rankings</li>
        <li>Real-time notifications of successful updates</li>
        <li>Scalable solution that can be adapted for other fantasy sports platforms</li>
    </ul>

    <p>By addressing these challenges and implementing the proposed solution, the Best Ball Rankings Agent will significantly streamline the process of maintaining up-to-date player rankings, providing a valuable tool for fantasy sports enthusiasts and professionals alike.</p>
